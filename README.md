pessimist
---------

Pessimist is a tool that generates texts in English in response to the web articles (requires the URL of the web article).

This prototype currently supports configuration of the following:
- overall context sentiment and neutrality
- target tags' sentiment and neutrality
- wordings
- word counts

Weâ€™re deeply thankful to the CNN and NLP communities.
